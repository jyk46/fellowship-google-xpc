Microprocessor design has reached the limits of improving performance and
energy efficiency by scaling the number of general-purpose cores on a
chip. Instead, computer architects are turning toward a heterogeneous mix
of general-purpose cores and data-parallel accelerators to exploit the
ubiquitous data parallelism present in modern applications such as graph
processing, physical simulation, big data analytics, and machine
learning. Recent examples include the Intel
Haswell~\cite{hammarlund-intel-haswell-ieeemicro2014}, AMD
Kabini~\cite{bouvier-amd-kabini-ieeemicro2014}, and NVIDIA Tegra
4~\cite{krewell-nvidia-tegra4-mpr2013}, which integrate general-purpose
multicores with programmable graphics processing units (GPUs) at a coarse
granularity. Although this strategy has been promising, there is no clear
answer yet to the new challenges imposed by heterogeneous architectures,
like a unified software framework or optimal scheduling for adaptive
execution. In order to address these challenges, I believe the future
will move toward a more \emph{fine-grain intermingling} of many
lightweight general-purpose cores and data-parallel accelerators unified
under a single ISA with support for \emph{seamless adaptive execution} of
parallel tasks as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-intro-overview}.

Data-parallel accelerators like those used in current coarse-grain
heterogeneous architectures focus on exploiting \emph{conventional data
  parallelism} in which tasks generally have highly regular control and
memory-access structures and do not interact with each other.  However, a
growing number of modern applications exhibit a generalized form of data
parallelism called \emph{amorphous data parallelism} in which tasks can
conflict with each other, be generated dynamically, and modify the
underlying data structure~\cite{pingali-tao-pldi2011}. Mapping such
applications to current data-parallel accelerators can be difficult and
usually require aggressive software
optimizations~\cite{luo-gpu-bfs-dac2010,harish-large-graph-gpu-hipc2007,
  hong-cuda-max-warp-ppopp2011,nasre-data-vs-topo-ipdps2013,
  nasre-morph-ppopp2013,mendez-optimizations-amorphous-ppopp2010,
  mendez-gpu-pta-ppopp2012}. Ideally, future fine-grain heterogeneous
architectures would employ accelerators for a broader range of amorphous
data parallelism. These amorphous-data-parallel accelerators would be
specialized not only for varying degrees of irregularity, but also for
efficient conflict resolution or dynamic task generation. A broader range
of accelerators would provide more options for adaptively scheduling
tasks to accelerators they are best suited for.

This proposal outlines the Explicit-Parallel-Call (XPC) architecture, a
fine-grain heterogeneous architecture based on the concept of explicitly
encoding parallel tasks as parallel function calls in the software/hardware
interface. Figure~\ref{fig-intro-overview} highlights the vertically
integrated methodology that will be used to explore both software and
hardware techniques for \emph{exposing}, \emph{scheduling}, and
\emph{executing} fine-grain parallel tasks.
