\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

The XPC architecture provides a fundamentally different abstraction for
heterogeneous architectures by exposing fine-grain parallel tasks as
parallel function calls in the software/hardware interface. By exploring
both software and hardware approaches for exposing, scheduling, and
executing fine-grain parallel tasks, it is possible to identify
permutations yielding high performance and energy efficiency for a wide
range of amorphous data parallel applications with reasonable hardware
complexity overhead. The seamless adaptivity across a sea of
general-purpose and data-parallel accelerator tiles specialized for
exploiting a broad range of amorphous data parallelism is one promising
approach to address the significant challenges in technology and
applications facing computer architects today.
