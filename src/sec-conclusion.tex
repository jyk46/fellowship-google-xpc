\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

The XPC architecture provides a fundamentally different abstraction for
heterogeneous architectures by explicitly encoding parallel function
calls in the software/hardware interface. By exploring both software and
hardware approaches for exposing, scheduling, and executing fine-grain
parallel tasks, we can identify permutations yielding high performance
and energy efficiency for a wide range of amorphous data parallel
applications with reasonable hardware complexity overhead. We believe the
seamless adaptivity across a sea of general-purpose tiles and various
accelerators specialized for different forms of parallelism provided by
the XPC architecture is one promising approach to address the significant
challenges in technology and applications facing computer architecture
today.
